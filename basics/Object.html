        Object() is a constructor that creates objects, for example:

        >>> var o = new Object();

        This is the same as using the object literal:

        >>> var o = {}; // recommended

        You can pass anything to the constructor and it will try to guess what it is and
        use a more appropriate constructor.

         For example, passing a string to new Object() will be the same as using the new String() constructor.
               
         >>> var o = new Object('something');
        >>> o.constructor;   //       String()

        >>> var o = new Object(123);
        >>> o.constructor;  //  Number()
