    <h3>XMLHttpRequest</h3>
     <h4>XMLHttpRequest() is an object (a constructor function) that allows you to send <br />
            HTTP requests from JavaScript - Supported by all most all browsers
</h4>
    <pre>
       AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

    Asynchronous because after sending an HTTP request your code 
    doesn't need to wait for the response, but it can do other stuff and
     be notified (through an event) when the response arrives.

    XML because initially developers were making HTTP requests for XML 
    documents and were using the data contained in them to update the page. 

    Data can be  JSON format, or simply as HTML ready to be inserted into the page.

     Send the Request

    In order to create an object you simply use this

        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

        var xhr = new ActiveXObject('MSXML2.XMLHTTP.3.0'); //IE7
    
    The next thing is to attach an event listener to the readystatechange event fired by the object:

        xhr.onreadystatechange = myCallback;
        xhr.open('GET', 'somefile.txt', true);
        xhr.send('');

            XHR object called readyState. Every time it changes, the readystatechange event fires. 
    
    The possible values of the readyState property are as follows:
            0—uninitialized
            1—loading
            2—loaded
            3—interactive
            4—complete

            function myCallback() {
                    if (xhr.readyState < 4) {
                        return; // not ready yet
                        }
            if (xhr.status !== 200) {
                alert('Error!'); // the HTTP status code is not OK
                return;
                }
        // all is fine, do the work
            alert(xhr.responseText);
        }
</pre>
