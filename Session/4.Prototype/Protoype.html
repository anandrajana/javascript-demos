    <h1>Prototype - </h1>
    <hr/>
    <h3>JavaScript is classified as having a prototype-based object model.</h3>
    <h4>prototype property will be consulted when you try to access a property <br />that does not exist in the current object</h4>
    <pre>
            If you define a simple function foo() you can access its properties :

            >>> function foo(a, b){return a * b;}
            >>> foo.length;  //2

            >>> foo.constructor      //Function()

            prototype is a property that gets created as soon as we define the function. 
            Its initial value is an empty object.

            >>> typeof foo.prototype   // "object"

            It's as if you added this property yourself like this:
            >>> foo.prototype = {}

            You can augment this empty object with properties and methods. 
            They won't have any effect of the foo() function itself; 
            they'll only be used when you use foo()  as a constructor.

            Adding Methods and Properties Using the Prototype 
            -------------------------------------------------------
                function Gadget(name, color) {
                    this.name = name;
                    this.color = color;
                    this.whatAreYou = function(){
                            return 'I am a ' + this.color + ' ' + this.name;
                    }
            }
                Gadget.prototype.price = 100;
                Gadget.prototype.rating = 3;
                Gadget.prototype.getInfo = function() {
                    return 'Rating: ' + this.rating + ', price: ' + this.price;
                };

        OR

            Gadget.prototype = {
                    price: 100,
                    rating: 3,
                    getInfo: function() {
                        return 'Rating: ' + this.rating + ', price: ' + this.price;
                    }
            };

                >>> var newtoy = new Gadget('webcam', 'black');
                >>> newtoy.name;   //"webcam"
                >>> newtoy.color;       //"black"
                >>> newtoy.whatAreYou();    //"I am a black webcam"
                >>> newtoy.price;   //100
</pre>

        <h2>Enumerating Properties</h2>
    <pre>
            function Gadget(name, color) {
                this.name = name;
                this.color = color;
                this.someMethod = function(){return 1;}
            }
            Gadget.prototype.price = 100;
            Gadget.prototype.rating = 3;

            Creating a new object:

            var newtoy = new Gadget('webcam', 'black');

            Now if you loop using a for-in, you see of the object's all properties, including those that come from the prototype:

            for (var prop in newtoy) {
                console.log(prop + ' = ' + newtoy[prop]);
            }

            The result also contains the object's methods (as methods are just properties that happen to be functions):
             //output:
            name = webcam
            color = black
            someMethod = function () { return 1; }
            price = 100
            rating = 3

          If you want to distinguish between the object's own properties versus the prototype's properties,
            use hasOwnProperty(). Try first:
        
            >>> newtoy.hasOwnProperty('name');  //true
            >>> newtoy.hasOwnProperty('price') ;// false


                Let's loop again, but showing only own properties:

            for (var prop in newtoy) {
                if (newtoy.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
                    console.log(prop + '=' + newtoy[prop]);
                    }
                }
    
            The result:
                    name=webcam
                    color=black
                    someMethod=function () { return 1; }


        isPrototypeOf():
       -----------------

            Every object also gets the isPrototypeOf() method. This method tells you 
            whether that specific object is used as a prototype of another object.

        Let's take a simple object monkey.
            var monkey = {
                hair: true,
                feeds: 'bananas',
                breathes: 'air'
            };

                Now let's create a Human() constructor function and set its prototype property to point to monkey.

            function Human(name) {
                this.name = name;
            }
            Human.prototype = monkey;
                    
        Now if you create a new Human object called Murthy and ask: "Is monkey Murthy's prototype?", you'll get true.

        >>> var m = new Human('Murthy');
        >>> monkey.isPrototypeOf(m);//true

       Augmenting Built-in objects:
      -------------------------------
                Array.prototype.inArray = function(needle) {
                    for (var i = 0, len = this.length; i < len; i++) {
                        if (this[i] === needle) {
                            return true;
                }
            }
                    return false;
        }

        Now all arrays will have the new method. Let's test:

            >>> var a = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
            >>> a.inArray('red');
</pre>
    <h3>Best Practice:
        If you decide to augment the prototype of built-in objects with a new property, 
    <br />do check for existence of the new property first.</h3>

    <h3>Protytype Gotchas</h3>
    <pre>
            
            Here are two interesting behaviors to consider when dealing with prototypes:

        The prototype chain is live with the exception of when you completely replace the prototype object
        prototype.constructor is not reliable

            Creating a simple constructor function and two objects:
                    >>> function Dog(){this.tail = true;}
                    >>> var benji = new Dog();
                    >>> var rusty = new Dog();

                    Even after you create the objects, you can still add properties to the prototype
                 and the objects will have access to the new properties. Let's throw in the method say():

                >>> Dog.prototype.say = function(){return 'Woof!';}
                    
                        Both objects have access to the new method:
                
                    >>> benji.say //"Woof!"

                >>> rusty.say();    //"Woof!"

                    Up to this point if you consult your objects, asking which constructor function 
                    was used to create them, they'll report it correctly.

                    >>> benji.constructor;   //Dog()
            
                >>> rusty.constructor;   //Dog()

                    It is interesting to note that if you ask what is the constructor of the 
                    prototype object, you'll also get Dog(), which is not quite correct.
                     The prototype is just a normal object created with Object(). 
                    It doesn't have any of the properties of an object constructed with Dog().

                    >>> benji.constructor.prototype.constructor  ;//     Dog()
                    >>> typeof benji.constructor.prototype.tail   //"undefined"

                    Now let's completely overwrite the prototype object with a brand new object:

                    >>> Dog.prototype = {paws: 4, hair: true};

                    It turns out that our old objects do not get access to the new prototype's properties; 
                        they still keep the secret link pointing to the old prototype object:
            
                    >>> typeof benji.paws       ;//"undefined"
                    >>> benji.say()  ;//"Woof!"
