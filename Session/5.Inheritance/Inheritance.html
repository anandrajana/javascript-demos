        function Shape() {
            this.name = 'shape';
            this.toString = function () { return this.name; };

        Triangle.prototype = new TwoDShape();
        var my = new Triangle(5, 10);
        console.log("Area :" + my.getArea());
        console.log(my.toString());  // Triangle

        // it is good idea to reset constructor to avoid overwriting prototype to avoid side affects
        TwoDShape.prototype.constructor = TwoDShape;
        Triangle.prototype.constructor = Triangle;
        console.log(my.constructor); // Triangle(side, height)

        /*

        It's interesting to note what the JavaScript engine does when you call my.toString():

        It loops through all of the properties of my and doesn't find a method called toString().

        It looks at the object that my.__proto__ points to; this object is the instance
                new TwoDShape() created during the inheritance process.

        Now the JavaScript engine loops through the instance of TwoDShape and doesn't find a toString() method. 
               It then checks the __proto__ of that object. This time __proto__ points to the instance created by new Shape().

        The instance of new Shape() is examined and toString() is finally found!

        This method is invoked in the context of my, meaning that this points to my.

        If you ask my, "who's your constructor?" it will report it correctly
        because of the constructor property reset that we did after inheriting:

        my.constructor ; Triangle(side, height)

        */

        //  Using the instanceof operator you can validate that my is an instance of all three constructors.
        console.log("instance of shape :"+(my instanceof Shape));  //true
        console.log("instance of  TwoDShape :" + (my instanceof TwoDShape)); //true
        console.log("instance of Triangle" + (my instanceof Triangle));//true        
        console.log("instance of Array :"+( my instanceof Array));//false

    <h1>Inheritance</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Prototype Chaining is the default way to implement inheritance (ECMA script)</h2>    
    <pre>
     in javascript every function has a prototype property, which contains an object. 
     When this function is invoked using the new operator,
      an object is created and this object has a secret link to the prototype object.

    The secret link (called __proto__ in some environments) allows methods and properties 
    of the prototype object to be used as if they belong to the newly-created object.

     The prototype object is just a regular object and therefore
     it also contains a link to its prototype. And so a chain is created, called a prototype chain.

    A (_proto_) --> B (_proto_) --> C (_proto_) -->Object --> null

      an object A contains a number of properties. One of the properties is the hidden __proto__ property, 
        which points to another object, B.   B's __proto__ property points to C. 
     
     This chain ends with the Object object, which is the highest-level parent, and every object inherits from it.
</pre>

    <h3>// Inheriting Prototype only - Best practise - Refined version (see above code in script tag)</h3>
    <pre>
        function Shape(){};
        // augment prototype
            Shape.prototype.name = 'shape';
            Shape.prototype.toString = function() {return this.name;};
       
         function TwoDShape(){}
        // take care of inheritance
            TwoDShape.prototype = Shape.prototype;
            TwoDShape.prototype.constructor = TwoDShape;
        
        // augment prototype
            TwoDShape.prototype.name = '2D shape';
            function Triangle(side, height) {
                    this.side = side;
                    this.height = height;
        }
        // take care of inheritance
            Triangle.prototype = TwoDShape.prototype;
            Triangle.prototype.constructor = Triangle;
        
        // augment prototype
                Triangle.prototype.name = 'Triangle';
                Triangle.prototype.getArea = function(){return this.side * this.height / 2;}
        
        The test code will give the same result:
        >>> var my = new Triangle(5, 10);
        >>> my.getArea();  //25
        >>> my.toString()  ;  //"Triangle"
</pre>
   
    <h3>This means that inheriting the object contained in Shape.prototype is better <br />
          than inheriting the object created with new Shape(). 

    <br /> After all, new Shape() will only give you own shape properties which are not meant to be reused
    <br /> (otherwise they would be in the prototype). 
    <br /> You gain a little more efficiency by:
<br />Not creating a new object for the sake of inheritance alone, and
<br />Having less lookups during runtime when it comes to searching for toString() for example.</h3>

    <h1>Multiple inheritance</h1>
    <pre>
           
        Multiple inheritance is where a child inherits from more than one parent:

            function multi() {
                var n = {}, stuff, j = 0, len = arguments.length;
                for (j = 0; j < len; j++) {
                    stuff = arguments[j];
                    for (var i in stuff) {
                    n[i] = stuff[i];
                }
            }
            return n;
        }

            var shape = {
                name: 'shape',
                toString: function() {return this.name;}
            };

            var twoDee = {
                name: '2D shape',
                dimensions: 2
            };

            var triangle = multi(shape, twoDee, {
                name: 'Triangle',
                getArea: function(){return this.side * this.height / 2;},
                side: 5,
                height: 10
            });

            console.log( triangle.getArea());   //25
            console.log( triangle.dimensions);  //2
            console.log(triangle.toString()) ;// triangle    
</pre>
    <h1>Mixin</h1>
    <pre>
            Mixin is an object that provides some useful functionality but is not meant 
            to be inherited and extended by sub-objects.
    
         When we create a new object we can pick and choose any other objects to mix into your new object. 

        By passing them all to multi() you get all their functionality without making them part of the inheritance tree.
</pre>

    <h1>Parasitic Inheritance</h1>

    <h3>a function that creates objects by taking all of the functionality of another object, 
    <br />augmenting it and returning it, "pretending that it has done all the work".</h3>
    <pre>
            object literal, and unaware of the fact that it is soon going to fall victim to parasitism:
        
            var twoD = {
                name: '2D shape',
                dimensions: 2
                };

                A function that creates triangle objects could:

                1. Clone the twoD object into an object called that by copying all properties.
                2. Augment that with more properties.
                3. Return that.

                function triangle(s, h) {
                        var that = object(twoD);
                        that.name ='Triangle';
                        that.getArea = function(){return this.side * this.height / 2;};
                        that.side = s;
                        that.height = h;
                        return that;
                    }

                Because triangle() is a normal function, not a constructor, it doesn't require the new operator.
                But because it returns an object, calling it with new by mistake will work in exactly the same way.

                >>> var t = triangle(5, 10);
                >>> t.dimensions    ;//2
                >>> var t2 = new triangle(5,5);
                >>> t2.getArea();  // 12.5

</pre>
    <h1>Borrowing a Constructor</h1>
    <h3>The constructor of the child calls the constructor of the parent <br />using either of the call() or apply() methods.</h3>
    <pre>
            function Shape(id) {
                this.id = id;
                }
            Shape.prototype.name = 'shape';
            Shape.prototype.toString = function(){return this.name;};

            Define Triangle() which uses apply() to call the Shape()
            constructor, passing this (an instance created with new Triangle()) and any additional arguments.

            function Triangle() {
                Shape.apply(this, arguments);
                }
        
            Triangle.prototype.name = 'Triangle';

                >>> var t = new Triangle(101);
                >>> t.name   //"Triangle"

            The new triangle object inherits the id property from the parent, 
            but it doesn't inherit anything added to the parent's prototype:

            >>> t.id   ;// 101
            >>> t.toString();   // "[object Object]"

                function Triangle() {
                Shape.apply(this, arguments);
                }
                Triangle.prototype = new Shape();
                Triangle.prototype.name = 'Triangle';
